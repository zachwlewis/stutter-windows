Stutter is a productivity tool designed around the [Pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Its main goal is to allow a user to marry the current phrase (pomodoro) with a concrete task. With repeated phrases, the user is given a random task to focus on, preventing burnout and letting the subconsious work on problems that may have been encountered on previous tasks.
